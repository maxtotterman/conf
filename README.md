# dotfiles
My configurations files, nothing fancy to adore.

Trying to use as little OS dependant(osx/linux) tools and configuration as possible.


I've structured each software in folders, containing configurations,themes,plugins yada yada.

I create symlinks in correct places(usually in `~/`) and pointing them to the correct file in the `.dotfiles` folder.


## Software

Terminal emulator - [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

Code editor - [vim](https://www.vim.org/)

Shell - [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
